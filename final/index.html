    <h1> Mushroom & Potato Tacos </h1>
    <h3> For this hearty vegetarian meal, weʼre filling soft flour tortillas with mushrooms and potato—seasoned with a zesty, chorizo-inspired blend, then roasted. A pickled pepper relish lends bright flavor to the tacos, all tied together with a creamy sauce seasoned with the same spices. Our side salad of juicy orange and crunchy romaine rounds out
        the dish.</h3>

    <h2>1 Prepare & roast the vegetables:</h2>
    <h3>Preheat the oven to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Quarter the
        mushrooms. Quarter the potatoes lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-
        inch pieces. Place the vegetables on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and
        season with salt, pepper, and 3/4 of the spice blend; toss to coat. Arrange
        in an even layer. Roast 21 to 23 minutes, or until browned and tender when
        pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.</h3>
    
    <h2>2 Prepare the remaining ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>While the vegetables roast, roughly chop the piquante peppers. Peel and
        small dice the shallot. Cut off and discard the root end of the lettuce;
        roughly chop the leaves. Peel and medium dice the orange. Cut off and
        discard the ends of the radishes; halve lengthwise, then thinly slice
        crosswise. Roughly chop the jalapeño pepper; thoroughly wash your hands
        and cutting board immediately after handling. In a bowl, combine the sour
        cream, a drizzle of olive oil, and as much of the remaining spice blend
        as you’d like (you may have extra). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</h3>
    
    <h2>3 Warm the tortillas:</h2>
    <h3>While the vegetables continue to roast, place the tortillas on a large piece of
        aluminum foil. Tightly wrap to seal. Place directly onto the oven rack and
        warm 5 to 7 minutes, or until heated through and pliable. Transfer to a work
        surface and carefully unwrap.</h3>
    
    <h2>4 Make the pepper relish:</h2>
    <h3>While the tortillas warm, in a medium bowl, combine the chopped
        piquante peppers, diced shallot, half the vinegar, and as much of
        the chopped jalapeño pepper as you’d like, depending on how spicy
        you’d like the dish to be. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and
        pepper to taste.</h3>

    <h2>5 Assemble the tacos & serve your dish:</h2>
    <h3>Spread a layer of the seasoned sour cream onto the warmed tortillas.
        Top with the roasted vegetables and pepper relish. Serve the tacos with
        the salad on the side. Enjoy!</h3>
