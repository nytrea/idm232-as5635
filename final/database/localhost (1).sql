(38, 'Tilapia & Black Lentil Salad with Lemon Pan Sauce', 'In this dish, weʼre putting a twist on Italian gremolata: adding pickled peppers to the classic parsley, garlic, and lemon condiment. The bright, tangy flavors perk up a hearty salad of black lentils and roasted broccoli. Weʼre also using lemon juice as the base for an easy pan sauce to serve over our seared tilapia.', '½ cup Black Beluga Lentils 2 cloves Garlic 1 Lemon ½ lb Broccoli 1 bunch Parsley 2 Tbsps Butter 1 oz Golden Or Red Sweet Piquante Peppers 1 Tbsp Capers', '1.Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Heat a medium saucepan of salted water to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the lentils and cook, uncovered, 24 to 26 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and rinse under warm water; return to the pot. Cover to keep warm.  2.While the lentils cook, wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into small pieces, keeping the florets intact. Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.  3.While the broccoli roasts, peel the garlic. Roughly chop 1 clove. Finely chop the remaining clove; using the flat side of your knife, smash until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Using a peeler, remove the yellow rind of the lemon, avoiding the white pith; mince the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Quarter and deseed the lemon. Roughly chop the peppers. Finely chop the parsley leaves and stems. To make the gremolata, in a bowl, combine the lemon zest, chopped peppers, half the chopped parsley, the juice of 2 lemon wedges, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and as much of the garlic paste as you’d like. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  4.Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fillets and cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until lightly browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate.  5.Add the capers, chopped garlic, butter, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. Cook on mediumhigh, stirring constantly and scraping up any fond, 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned and fragrant. Turn off the heat; stir in the juice of the remaining lemon wedges (be careful, as the liquid may splatter). Season with salt and pepper to taste.  6.To the saucepan of cooked lentils, add the roasted broccoli and gremolata. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the finished lentils with the cooked fish fillets. Top the fish with the pan sauce. Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley. Enjoy!', ''),
